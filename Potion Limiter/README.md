# Potion Limiter Script
1. Download potionLimiter.lua and put it in your scripts\custom folder, also download vanillapotions.json and put it in your data\custom folder
2. In customScripts.lua, add the following require statement
```
potionLimiter = require("custom.potionLimiter")
```

note: quickkeys bypass onPlayerItemUse but it's planned to be fixed eventually
