# Ragefire scripts (may or may not be used by ragefire, but are made at snapjaw's request)
1. Download DungeonLoot.lua (in this folder not the other one), ragefireone.json, and ragefireTieredItem.lua
2. Put them in scripts and data folders respectively (json in data, lua in scripts)
3. Follow instructions from the DungeonLoot readme to set that up ("dungeonchest_ragefire_one") is the default id format for a tier one item
4. For items looks for json files tierOneArmor.json, tierOneCE.json, tierOneClothing.json, and tierOneWeapons.json
